        <p class="Welcome">Hello Mario learner!!<br>
            I am Ethan an  AI  robot warm welcome to the site. </p>
        <p class="question">What is Mario learning?</p>
        <p class="describe">Mario Learning is a project website which consists machine learning<br>
            The website is designed to provide a comprehensive set of resources and tools to help<br>
            users understand the fundamentals of machine learning and apply these concepts <br>
            to real-world problems. The website is structured around a series of modules that <br>
            cover different aspects of machine learning. These modules include topics such as data <br>
            preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation. Each module is designed <br>
            to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the topic, including both theoretical and <br>
            practical aspects. In addition to the modules, the Mario Learning website also provides a number of <br>
            tools and resources to help users learn and apply machine learning concepts These resources include <br>
