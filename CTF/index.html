    Once there was a person named selenophile. <br>
    He used to store lots of secrect with him.<br>
    Later on some unexpected AI from outer world attacked and stole those secrects from him and hide them away on diffrent places.<br>
    Now you Have to find those secrects and help selenophile to regain his memory cause without them he can function properly.
    <!-- selenophile has little bit of memory he saw those AI's escaping using their air ship (https://m7-selenophile.github.io/CTF/airship)-->
